# @vadistic/monorepo

> Personal @vadistic monorepo template - configs for react & node monorepos with typescript

## Why

- I kinda like creating monorepos of tiny packages for everything
- No-config tools like parcel, tsdx or cra are not configurable enough...
- It actually saves time to have one source of "configuration truth"
- I guess I like configs ðŸ¤·

## Usage

```sh

# clone whole thing

$ git clone https://github.com/vadistic/monorepo

# or just package you need

$ npx degit https://github.com/vadistic/monorepo/parcel-app

```
